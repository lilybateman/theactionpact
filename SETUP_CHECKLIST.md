## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

When everything is working, you should see:
- âœ… Form submission shows success message
- âœ… Google Sheet has new row with your test data
- âœ… No errors in browser console (F12)
- âœ… Data appears with timestamp, name, email, and city

## ðŸ†˜ If Something's Not Working

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for error messages
2. **Verify webhook URL** is correct and accessible
3. **Ensure Apps Script** is deployed as web app
4. **Check permissions** - script needs access to Google Sheets
5. **Test webhook URL** by visiting it in browser (should show status message)

## ðŸ“ž Quick Help

- **Webhook URL format**: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec`
- **Common error**: "Webhook URL not configured" - means you need to add your URL
- **Permission issues**: Re-authorize the Apps Script when prompted
- **CORS errors**: Make sure "Who has access" is set to "Anyone"
