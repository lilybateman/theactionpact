## üéØ Alternative Approach

If none of the above work, you can try this workaround:

### Step 1: Use Existing Project
1. **Go to** [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. **Look for existing projects** - you might already have one
3. **Open an existing project** or create a new one
4. **Copy your code** into the existing project

### Step 2: Manual Setup
1. **Open your Google Sheet** directly
2. **Add headers manually**:
   - Click cell A1 and type "Timestamp"
   - Click cell B1 and type "Name"
   - Click cell C1 and type "Email"
   - Click cell D1 and type "City"
3. **Format headers**:
   - Select cells A1:D1
   - Click "Bold" (B) button
   - Change background color if desired

### Step 3: Test Without Setup Function
1. **Skip the `setupSheet()` function** for now
2. **Deploy the web app** directly
3. **Test with a form submission** - the headers will be created automatically

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

**If none of the above work**:

3. **Wait 24 hours** and try again (Google issues often resolve themselves)
4. **Contact Google Support** if the issue persists

**Quick Test**: Try visiting [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) in an incognito window - if it works there, it's a browser cache issue.
